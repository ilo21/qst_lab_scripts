Python scripts used to control [QST.lab Thermal Cutaneous Stimulator](https://www.qst-lab.eu/)<br><br>
[thermal_stimuli.py](https://github.com/ilo21/qst_lab_scripts/blob/main/src/thermal_stimuli.py) script interacts also with [Neurospec: MMBT-S Trigger Interface Box](https://shop.neurospec.com/mmbt-s-trigger-interface-box)<br><br>
The example of user interface:<br><br>

<br>
The above is the example of the program that will help to detect painful temperature for each individual.<br>
Graphical user interface allows to set the correct COM port of the device, session information, start temperature and the duration of each stimulus.<br>
The temperature will be gradually increased by 1 degree C, until the user responds that it is painful.
